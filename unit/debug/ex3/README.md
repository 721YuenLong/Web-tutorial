## Installation

1. Softlink this directory to your `public_html`.
2. Visit the [website](http://[host]/~[account]/ex3/).

## Description

This is a html/css example.

1. Layer1, 2 and 3 should be red, blue and green, respectively.
2. However, the forth `layer2` is blue.  Try to fix it.

Note that good indentation makes it easy to debug.  Otherwise, you will find this example is very hard.
