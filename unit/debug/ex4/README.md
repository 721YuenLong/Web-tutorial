This is a html/css/js debug example.
1. If you click the button, the red box should move to right, become
   bigger, and then move back to left, become original size. There
   are three points to be corrected in this web.
2. Check the order of cdn of jQuery and script of main.js if it causes
   'Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not define'.
3. When clicking the button, the red box should move to right and
   back to origin. Check why the 'left' style doesn't work.
4. If we continously click the button, the animation will have a
   delay. Try to fix it.
