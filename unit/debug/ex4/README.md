# Debug example 4

## Installation

1. Softlink this directory to your `public_html`.
2. Visit the [website](http://[host]/~[account]/ex4/).

## Description

This is a html/css/js example.  When clicking the `click me` button, the red box should:

1. Move to the right and scale up.
2. Move back to the left and scale down.

Try to fix it.

Hints:
* If you see the error message: `Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not define`, it means that you do not have jQuery.
* Think about the order of importing jQuery and `app.js`.
* We use `left` property to move the box.  The document of `left` would be helpful.
