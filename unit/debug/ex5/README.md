# Debug example 5

## Description

You can softlink this directory to your public_html.
Visit the [website](http://[host]/~[account]/ex5)

This is a html/js debug example.
1. If you click the button, the web page should show 'A' after 1 sec first,
   and then show 'B' after 1 sec.
2. When clicking the button, the web page will show 'A' and 'B' at the 
   same time. Check why the 'setTimeout' function in app.js doesn't work.
3. Try to fix it.
4. Hint: Use Promise or async function.
