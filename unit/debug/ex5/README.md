# Debug example 5

## Installation

1. Softlink this directory to your `public_html`.
2. Visit the [website](http://[host]/~[account]/ex5/).

## Description

This is a html/js example.  When clicking the `click me` button, the web page is expected to show 'A' after one second and then show 'B' after another second.  However, right now it shows 'A' and 'B' together.  Try to fix it.

Hints:
* The document of `setTimeout()` would be helpful.
* This is an asynchronous issue, here are some helpful terms: `promise`, `async` and `await`.  Google them with `js`.
